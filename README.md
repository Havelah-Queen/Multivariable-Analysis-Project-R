Model Selection, Boston University, School of Public Health   Boston, MA   
	Conducted predictive modeling and machine learning analyses within RStudio using a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial to investigate factors driving cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Exploratory data analysis included outlier removal, variable transformations, collinearity checks, PCA, and K-means clustering. Utilized AIC/BIC model selection and classification trees to identify significant predictors. Further assessed models using cross-validation and train-test splitting, comparing via c-statistics and ROC curve analysis. Presented findings with a slide deck and written report.
