## Project Overview
Crafted a research proposal with aims to identify the most influential predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and compare different modeling approaches. Conducted predictive modeling and machine learning analyses within RStudio using the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) drug trial educational dataset. Exploratory data analysis included outlier removal, variable transformations, collinearity checks, PCA, and K-means clustering. Utilized AIC/BIC model selection and classification trees to identify significant predictors. Further assessed models using cross-validation, comparing ROC curves and c-statistics. Presented findings with a slide deck and written report.
